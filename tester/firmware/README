In order to install the IPBus library, follow the software readme file.

To generate the IPbus addresses .vhdl file:

- source the environment 
- cd firmware
- make dynamic_vhdl 

To build the FPGA Top project:

- Check the installation of openpyxl library. Otherwise sudo apt-get install python3-openpyxl

- make init         = Initialize the project
- make compile		= Compile the project
- make implement	= Implement the project
- make program		= Program FPGA
(NOTE: you need to have djtgcfg installed.. and, of course, an fpga board connected)

If after program, you get: "sh: 1: gvim: not found"
install gvim with: 
$ sudo apt install vim-gtk3
(just the editor to display the reports)


To check if the Digilent JTAG interface is correctly installed (djtgcfg):
 djtgcfg -v

Programming VC707 Virtex 7 BPI Flash

1) Generate a bitstream (.bit) file in the normal way.

2) Run this TCL command inside Vivado:

$ write_cfgmem -format mcs -interface bpix16 -size 128 -loadbit "up 0x0 /path/to/bitfile.bit" -file mynewmcs.mcs

(The bitfile is located in /firmware/bin)

3) Open Vivado 

4) Open Hardware Manager, open target board

5) Add or Select a memory device:  mt28gu01gaax1e-bpi-x16 >>>> Program configuration memory device 

7) Add your .mcs file to the Configuration File field

8) Hit OK

9) Right click on device >> Boot from Configuration Memory Device

-) Jtag inserted -> M0,M1,M2 (010, 101) you can program the FPGA
-) M0,M1,M2 (101) -> BPI not working 
-) M0,M1,M2 (010) -> BPI working | if jtag connected, press button to programm or by vivado | if jtag not connected will program it automatically from flash
